I see that you are in the good mood for Alice's story in the Wonderland
Wonderland is a world where Alice go after falling into the Rabbit Hole. 
It seems to look like a big garden where animals can talk just like humans.
The Cheshire Cat says to Alice that she would not have come there if she wasn't mad.
