The Mouse is one of the first creatures that Alice offends by mentioning her cat, Dinah. 
There's a certain morbid humor in Alice's inability to understand that mice might not want to hear about animals that slaughter them. 
The Mouse also parodies the boring, just-memorizing-things-without-thinking kind of scholar. 
In order to get the group of animals and birds who fell into Alice's tears dry, the Mouse starts reciting a history of England. 
It actually seems quite radical for Carroll to imply that English history is completely boring and that he'd rather tell a story about a pretend world.
