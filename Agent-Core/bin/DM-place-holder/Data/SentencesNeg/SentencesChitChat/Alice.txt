I see that you are not in a great mood today. Let's me tell you a bit about Alice to cheer you up. 
Alice is a sensible prepubescent girl from a wealthy English family who finds herself in a strange world ruled by imagination and fantasy. 
Alice feels comfortable with her identity and has a strong sense that her environment is comprised of clear, logical, and consistent rules and features. 
Alice's familiarity with the world has led one critic to describe her as a disembodied intellect.
Alice displays great curiosity and attempts to fit her diverse experiences into a clear understanding of the world.
