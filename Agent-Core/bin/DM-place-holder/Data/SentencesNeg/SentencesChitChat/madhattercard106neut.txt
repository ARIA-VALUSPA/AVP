The card is a price tag in old English money: pounds, shillings and pennies, which was then written as l/s/d. 
Lewis Carroll has explained the meaning of the tag in his 'Nursery Alice':
The Hatter used to carry about hats to sell: and even the one that he's got on his head is meant to be sold. 
You see it's got its price marked on it - a "10" and a "6" - that means "ten shillings and sixpence."
