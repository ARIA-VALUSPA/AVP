alice
Alice, an unpretentious and individual 19-year-old, is betrothed to a dunce of an English nobleman. 
At her engagement party, she escapes the crowd to consider whether to go through with the marriage and falls down a hole in the garden after spotting an unusual rabbit. 
Arriving in a strange and surreal place called "Underland," she finds herself in a world that resembles the nightmares she had as a child, 
filled with talking animals, villainous queens and knights, and frumious bandersnatches. 
Alice realizes that she is there for a reason--to conquer the horrific Jabberwocky and restore the rightful queen to her throne.
