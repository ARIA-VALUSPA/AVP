I see that you are not in a great mood. Shall I tell you a story about the Queen of Hearts to cheer you up?
As the ruler of Wonderland, the Queen of Hearts is the character that Alice must inevitably face to figure out the puzzle of Wonderland. 
In a sense, the Queen of Hearts is literally the heart of Alice's conflict. 
Unlike many of the other characters in Wonderland, the Queen of Hearts is not as concerned with nonsense and perversions of logic as she is with absolute rule and execution. 
In Wonderland, she is a singular force of fear who even dominates the King of Hearts. 
In the Queen's presence, Alice finally get a taste of true fear, even though she understands that the Queen of Hearts is merely a playing card. 
The Gryphon later informs Alice that the Queen never actually executes anyone she sentences to death, which reinforces the fact that the Queen of Hearts's power lies in her rhetoric. 
The Queen becomes representative of the idea that Wonderland is devoid of substance.
